## The CIA Triad 🖌️

The CIA Triad is a way to understand and ensure security in information systems. It stands for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `CIA Triad ek tareeka hai information systems mein suraksha ko samajhne aur ensure karne ka. Yeh Confidentiality, Integrity, aur Availability ke liye stand karta hai.`

 01. Confidentiality - This means only authorized people can access certain information, and it should be protected from being shared with unauthorized individuals.
>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
 > `01. Confidentiality: Iska matlab hai sirf authorized log hi kuch khaas jaankari tak pahunch sakte hain, aur yeh unauthorized logon se share hone se bachani chahiye. `
 02. Integrity - This is about the accuracy and reliability of information. it ensures that data is complete, accurate, and consistent, and it con be trusted for its intended purpose.
>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
 > `02. Integrity: Yeh jaankari ke sahi aur vishwasniy hone ke baare mein hai. Yeh yeh assure karta hai ki data poori tarah se sahi, satik, aur consistent hai, aur ise uske iraade ke liye vishwasniya kiya ja sakta hai.`
 03. Availability - This refers to the accessibility of systems and data when users need them. it ensures that resources are accessible and usable when required, without any interruptions or delays.
>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
 > `03. Availability: Yeh systems aur data ki upalabdhata ko jab users ko zaroorat ho tab accessible hone ka matlab hai. Yeh yeh ensure karta hai ki resourses jab chahiye tab uplabdh aur upyogshil hon, kisi bhi beech batai ya rukavat ke bina.`

In simpler terms, the CIA Triad helps in keeping information safe (Confidentiality), reliable (integrity), and accessible (availability).

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `Saral shabdon mein kaha jaye toh, CIA Triad jaankari ko surakshit (confidentiality), vishwasniy (integrity), aur upalabdh (availability) rakhne mein madad karta hai.` 



## CIA Triad Deep Dive 🖌️

#### 01. Confidentiality: 
***Confidentiality*** is about keeping information safe and secure. It's a bit tricky because sometimes users of a system might not be trustworthy, or they might access the system from unsafe devices or apps. So, security pros need to control who can access what—protecting important data while letting authorized people get to it.

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `Confidentiality ka matlab hai jaankari ko surakshit aur secure rakhna. Yeh thoda mushkil hai kyunki kabhi-kabhi system ke users bharosemand nahi hote, ya phir woh unsafe devices ya apps se system ko access karte hain. Isliye, suraksha professionals ko yeh dekhna hota hai ki kaun kya access kar sakta hai—mahatvapurn data ko bachate hue authorised logon ko us tak pahunchne dena.`

***Personally Identifiable Information (PII)*** is a part of confidentiality. It includes any data that can identify someone, like their name or address. Other terms related to confidentiality are ***Protected Health Information (PHI)***, which is about a person's health, and ***classified or sensitive information***, like trade secrets or business plans.

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `Personally Identifiable Information (PII) confidentiality ka hissa hai. Isme kisi ko identify karne wale koi bhi data shaamil hota hai, jaise naam ya pata. Aur confidentiality se judi dusri terms hain jaise Protected Health Information (PHI), jo kisi vyakti ki sehat se judi hoti hai, aur classified ya sensitive information, jaise trade secrets ya business plans.`

Another term is ***sensitivity***, which measures how important information is and how much it needs protecting. Sensitive information is stuff that, if it gets out or gets changed, could harm a person or a company. Sometimes, sensitivity is about how much harm it could cause to people or groups outside the organization that owns the info.

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `Ek aur term hai sensitivity, jo batata hai ki jaankari kitni mahatvapurn hai aur uski kitni suraksha ki zaroorat hai. Sensitive information woh hoti hai jo, agar bahar chali jaaye ya badal di jaaye, kisi vyakti ya company ko nuksan pahuncha sakti hai. Kabhi-kabhi sensitivity yeh bhi batati hai ki kitna nuksan kisi vyakti ya group ko ho sakta hai jo us jaankari ka maalik nahi hai.`

#### 02. Integrity:

***Integrity*** means things are whole, complete, and accurate. It applies to:

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `Integrity ka matlab hai ki cheezein poori, complete aur sahi hain. Yeh cheezon mein apply hota hai:`

- Information or data
- Systems and processes used in business
- Organizations
- People and their actions

***Data integrity*** ensures data hasn't been tampered with. It means protecting data from unauthorized changes, errors, or loss during storage, processing, and transmission.

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `Data integrity yeh ensure karta hai ki data mein kisi ne bina ijazat ke koi badlav nahi kiya hai. Iska matlab hai data ko unauthorized changes, errors, ya information loss se bachana storage, processing aur transmission ke dauraan.`

Information must be accurate and consistent across systems. This consistency ensures info is correct everywhere it's stored or shown.

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `Jaankari ko sahi aur consistent rakhna zaroori hai. Yeh consistency yeh ensure karta hai ki jaankari har jagah sahi dhang se store aur dikhayi ja rahi hai.`

***System integrity*** means systems operate as they should. It's about maintaining a known good configuration and expected function while processing data.

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `System integrity ka matlab hai ki systems waisa hi kaam kare jaisa unka hona chahiye. Yeh data ko process karte waqt ek known good configuration aur expected function maintain karna hai.`

To ensure integrity, we start by understanding the current state of data or a system, creating a ***baseline***. Then, we compare this baseline with the current state to check if anything's changed. If they match, integrity's intact; if not, it's compromised.

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `Integrity ko ensure karne ke liye, hum current state ko samajhte hain, aur ek baseline create karte hain. Phir, hum current state ko baseline ke saath compare karte hain ki kuch badla hai ya nahi. Agar match hota hai, toh integrity hai; agar nahi, toh compromised hai.`

Integrity is vital for trustworthy information and systems, often dictated by laws or the organization's needs for reliable data.

>##### [ ✒️ explain in Hindi ]
> `Integrity vishwasniya jaankari aur systems ke liye mahatvapurn hai, aur yeh aksar kanoon ya sangathan ki zarooraton ke mutabiq hota hai.`
